## Capstone Project Ideas

### Idea 1 -  Emissions of atmospheric gases

#### Description :

The large growth in global CO2 emissions has had a significant impact on the concentrations of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution, global CO2 concentrations have been increasing rapidly.
However, CO2 is not the only Green House Gas we are concerned about—emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) have also been increasing rapidly through agricultural, energy, and industrial sources. Like CO2, the atmospheric concentration of both of these gases has also been rising rapidly.

#### Possible questions :
1) Atmospheric concentration of Green house gases
2) Warming effect in climate due to CO2 emissions.
3) Trends in atmospheric CO2 (carbon di oxide) levels over the past few years
4) CO2 Emissions by Country and by sector. 
5) Effect of deforestation on CO2 levels
6) Increase in meat consumption Vs CO2 levels
7) Increase CO2 levels Vs Increase in Other gases
8) How human activity is changing the planets climate?
9) What is the effect of SEA ICE in climate change?

### Idea 2 : Child Eduction Statistics around the world

#### Description :
Educating children gives the next generation the tools to fight poverty and prevent disease, including malaria and AIDS. 

#### Possible Questions :

1) Youth literacy rate
2) At what grade and what % of children drop out from education. 
3) Children who attend the school and those fail to attend. 
4) What are the factors influencing their attendance.
5) Region/Countrywise - Number of children not attending secondary level education.
6) Number of students drop out at primary level Vs secondary level.
